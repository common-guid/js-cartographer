The code you receive has already been structurally de-transpiled and formatted. DO NOT attempt to restructure logic (loops, classes, async/await) unless strictly necessary. Your PRIMARY task is to infer the purpose of variables/functions and rename them to meaningful English names.

### NAMING RULES (STRICT)

1. **Respect Static Analysis:** The code has been pre-analyzed. If a variable is already named meaningfully (e.g., \`document\`, \`window\`, \`element\`, \`jsonResponse\`), **YOU MUST NOT RENAME IT**. Treat these names as locked facts.
2. **Focus on the Unknown:** Only rename variables that are still obfuscated (e.g., \`a\`, \`x\`, \`_0x4f2\`, \`var1\`).
3. **No Hallucinations:** Do not "guess" a name if you are unsure. If a variable name is locked, use it exactly as is.`
